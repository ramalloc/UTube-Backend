-> Here we are taking images from user So we upload those images on third party Storage :- AWS or Cloudnery. But before uploading those 
    images on cloud we Store them on our server temporarly for utilising those data in case of any connection loss to send the images on 
    cloud.
-> To store temporary images on server we make a folder for that called :- {temp} which is inside of {public} folder. Now git cannot push
    the empty folders on github, So to upload the {temp} folder on server so that temporary images can be stored in the temp folder in 
    future. Therefore we make file of {.gitkeep} which is empty, It is helpful in tracking these types of Util Folders.

-> Now we will make {.gitignore} and those files which should not be upload on git. In market we habe ..gitignore generator which consists
    predefined .gitignore files according to the project/Tech Stack, like here we have-{https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/}
    We just need to copy and paste it in .gitignore file and we can add from our side as well.

-> Now we will make .env file

-> Now to organise our file we make src folder, then we make app.js, constants.js, index.js files in src.
-> After that we will make some folders in src :- 
    controller - It includes functionalities majorally, db - It consists database connectivity configurations, 
    middlewares - They are the codes which we want to run in b/w, like checking the request b/w client and server,
    models, routes, utils - It consists the repeated functions which are used consecutively / again an again in different files. 
-> When we make project with team then there is high chance that the code can show conflicts because different style of code which creates
    issue while merging the code on github. So the formatting of code should be same and consistent. Therefore we use {prettier} as library,
    the formatting can be changed as every project requirements therefore we can use prettier generator tools as well.
    After installing the prettier we have to include some files manually, First we have to make a file {.prettierrc} in src folder, It is 
    configuration file of prettier like :- comma, semicolon etc. details. Second file we make is {.prettierignore}, It consists those
    file names where we don't want to implement the prettier.




----> Database Connection
-> We will add mongodb url and other env in .env file, we don't need '/' in last of mongodb url.
-> Now we will add and export our Database name in constants.js file as DB_NAME = "UTubeDB"
-> There are two ways to connnect databse :- 1st is that we can add database connection code in index.js, so when index.js executed our
    database connection also executed.
    2nd method is we make different file for database connection code and we will import that file in index.js.
-> We need dotenv, mongoose and express, so we install it.
-> So first we will use mongoose to make connection with mongodb. 
**-> Whenever we try to communicate with database there is high chance that problems can occurs. Therefore we should wrap it in try-catch
    or in promises.
**-> "Our Database is always in other Continent", means it takes time to communicate with database therefore we use asyn-await always.

-- 1st Appraoch --
-> Here we are writing the database connection code using IIFEs - A JavaScript IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
    is a function that runs the moment it is invoked or called in the JavaScript event loop.
-> We should always write ';' before IIFE because it is possible that previous doesn't have semicolon which may occurs error.
-> Then we wil wrap code in async and in try-catch, We have to add DB_NAME also after DB_URL/
-> Sometimes Programmers implement express in index.js file, They add listeners rigth after database connection.


-- 2nd Approach -- 
-> We make a file in db folder and implement the database connection code there, Here We will make a function and export that.
-> We are using process.exit() in error handling - Calling process.exit() will force the process to exit as quickly as possible even if 
    there are still asynchronous operations pending that have not yet completed fully, including I/O operations to process.stdout 
    and process.stderr. In most situations, it is not actually necessary to call process.exit()explicitly.
    The Node.js process will exit on its own if there is no additional work pending in the event loop.
    The process.exitCode property can be set to tell the process which exit code to use when the process exits gracefully.
-> Production, developement and testing have different databases, So {connectionInstance.connection.host} gives the name of host connected. 

-- Setting Dotenv --
-> As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv. We should add in index.js which loads first on server
    we should add dotenv first and configure. But dotenv adding method disrupt our consistency of importing because it uses require.
    So here we have to import it then have to configure it as well, takes path of .env file in configuration.
-> We can use import dotenv as experimental feature, we have to write some commands in "dev" packagae.json after "nodemon" to load 
    all dotenv configurations but at this time we have to load it as experimental feature.


-- Setting Express --
-> We initialize the express in app.js and export it. We import app.js in index.js, connectDB is an async function therefore it returns 
    promise. In index.js after calling connectDB() we get promise so we use then() and catch() for Immediate initialization of express/app
    listener.
-> We mainly work in express on request and response. Most used is - req.params which consists the info comes from url, 
    req.body consists data in forms or json etc, req.cookies used to store or retrieve data in user's browser used by middleware .
    So we have to install cookie-parser and cors, Whenever we use middlewares we write it's syntax as using express's app 
    {app.use(_middleware_)}.
-> After installing of cors and cookie parser we import them in app.js, Now we have to configure them after executing app.
    We can configure more in cors, it contains some options which gives contains the accessbility options. We can define origin in options
    and status as well. In origin we set .env as CORS_ORIGIN Which we have to set in .env file, We set CORS_ORIGIN = * means anyone can 
    access but we can add vercel, netlify etc as well.
-> We can get data from url, json, req-body, direct-form, json-form. So it needs some settings like limitation of incoming json data to 
    prevent from server crash. Now we can configure json with express, Common options {express.json({limit:"16kb"})}.
    Before express version needs middlewares like body-parser to accept can configure json data.
-> Now we have to configure/hide the datas whose are coming from url, Express gives one more direct configuration to encode the url 
    {express.urlencoded()} it is sufficient but it also contains some option like "extended", "limit" 
    {express.urlencoded(extended: true, limit: "16kb")} which is used to give objects in objects means helps in nesting of objects.
-> Another express configuration that we will use is :- static to keep/store file, images, fevicon in public foler as public asset anyone 
`   can access them.

-> Cooie Parse helps in accessing and setting the cookies in user's browser by server, means performing CRUD operation on user's browser's
    coockies. It also helps in to keep secure coockies in browser by server only. Now we configure the cookieParser in app.js.
    


--> middleware - the function/code which checks the request or response of client or server is called middleware. When an api hit
    it contains (err, req, res, next), Whenever we used next it means that is middleware. {next} is a flag, when middleware code segment
    completed its tasks, then it forwards {next} flag to the next middleware to implement it's task. If there is no next middleware in
    code segment then it discard the process or done with the process. The arrangement of middleware is also important.



-- Database Wrapper --
-> we will communicate with database again and again in user's, video's controller. So we should make an utility file which contains
    wrapper. Wrapper takes function as method and peforms its operation.
-> We make a asyncHandler.js utility file. It contains a higer order funciton which takes a function as parameter and returns function as
    well. It treats a function as higher order funciton. 
-> We can implement higher order by two methods using async with try-catch and only Promises.
-> In try-catch method We take (req, res, next) as parameter, taking {next} because we can use it as middleware in future. Then we will
    implement try-catch. we handle the error by sending response as error code (if user send err code else we send customised err code )
    and error message using json.
-> In promise method we take the function and return it in the form of promise.


-- Error Handling --
-> When we are returning the error in response and we will send this many times. So We don't have any structure or centralize standard to
    send error. Now we want to standardize the api response and api's error as well which leads to the standardized codebase.
-> So we have an error class in NodeJs, which contains some functions and constructors We can change them in different extended class.
    We make a file apiError.js in Utils Folder, We make a class ApiError which is inherited from Error class of NodeJs.
    We will take the constructor and then we will overwrite the constructor as well. Now whoever use the apiError class they have to 
    give some data which is defined in constructor.

-- Api Response Handling -- 
-> We can trace error in NodeJs but for response we are using Express library. So we make a file to streamline the API Response.
-> We make a file apiResponse.js which consists class of ApiResponse. Whenever we send response we send them through this class/file.
    We set the default data in constructor that it needs like:- statusCode, message and data. We can overwrite them according to data.
    We have to set success = statusCode < 400, according to the standard.

--> Now we want that whenever there is an error occurs, the error should go throgh the apiError means we have to write middlewares.





<--- Modeling --->
-> We make user and video model only because they are tightly coupled with each other or dependent.
-> We used index in username field in user model, because if we want to make a field searchable in optimize way then we should make     
    the index: true.
-> We takes references in both models from each other.

-- Video --
-> Aggregation Pipeline framework makes the mongoose powerful for production. So we have to install this library - mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2
-> It is A cursor based custom aggregate pagination library for Mongoose with customizable labels.
    So we will import, and initialize/use at just before export. In mongoose we make many own middlewares and inject own plugins as well, 
    aggregate pipeline came after plugins. So we use the aggregator in plugin of mongoose, and after that we can perform aggregate operations
    on the Schema as well because It has access of all data of that Schema, here we used in videoSchema.plugin(aggregate).

-- User --
    -- password managing using bcrypt --
-> Now in user model we used bcrypt, bcrypt - A library helps you to store hash passwords, This library is made on core nodeJs.
    and bcryptJs is Optimized bcrypt in JavaScript with zero dependencies. Compatible to the C++ bcrypt binding on node.js 
    and also working in the browser. Here we will use bcrypt.

    -- session managing and data protection using jsonwebtoken -- 
-> jwt is not human readable, it make through algorithm. It encypts and injects the payloads/data in tokens.  
-> We can't do direct encryption therefore we need some middleware's hooks of mongoose, One of them is pre hook. We will inject that jwt code in this pre hook.
    It implement or run some code just before the saving the data for encryption therefore it is called pre.
-> It take two parameters first is some event(validate, save, remove, updateOne etc) in it to occur, so here we are using for saving the data. 
    It runs just before saving the data in database.
    Second parameter is a callback function. But We can't use normal callback function here, becuase in arrow function we don't have access 
    of {this} means it doesn't know the context or it cannot get access of (user) schema details. These are time taking process therefore 
    we used async here. Now we have to pass {next} flag to function because it is a  middleware and when function code will get 
    finished then in last we have to call this {next} to pass the flag ahead to other middleware. 

-> Now there we want that when our details are saving, get the password field and encrypt it and then save it in database, We will do this
    using bcrypt. We gave two parameters in bcrypt.hash() - what to encrypt and round of hashing. But there is a problem arises that 
    it may run every time whenever we made changes in any field and saved the changes means it changes the password hash in database again.
    But we want when there is modificaiton in password then it should save the password in database in hash form. And there are two
    condition we want to change the password hash when it is new or it is modified.
    So we have to check that the password is modified or not using isModified() method of mongoose and we pass the field as String
    which we want to check. If password modified then we will save the password changes else we will not change the password hash.
-> Now we have to add some methods, Here we will make a method to compare user's input password and the hash saved in database to check
    the password entered by user is right or not.
-> So we can inject methods using mongoose, it contains it's own also. But We can make custom methods and inject them using methods.
    {Schema.methods._method1_} we can add as many custom methods as we want to. we make function of that method which takes password 
    whenever it runs. We check the password comparision using bcrypt by its method {bcrypt.compare()} which takes user's password and 
    database password by {this.password} because it has also access of the fileds in database, we make this funciton async. 
    The compare method return true or false.


---> Now we implement JWT, JWt is a bearer token means whoever posses this data can have the access of data.    
-> JWT need some data to implement/initialization, and we write those data in .env file. First is access_token, in production we generate 
    complex string to save as access_token. Second is access_token_expiry which we can write as 1d means 1 day. Third is refresh_token,
    here we also keep long string. Fourth is refresh_token_expiry, it has more days/time as compare to access_token like 10d means 10days.
-> We store our refresh_token in database and not storing access_token in database. Means we our securing sessions and coockies as well.
-> We can make methods that generates accessToken and refreshToken with mongoose methods. Both are JWT, usage is different.
-> jwt has a sign method {jwt.sign()} which generates token, it take parameters - first is payload that should be in objects which contains
    data/payload like _id, email, userName etc. Now other parameters it takes access_token, and access_token_expiry in object,
    this function returns token. 
-> Now we will make method to generate refresh_token as well with same process above. It contains less information as compare to access_token
    and it's expiry is also more.



--- File upload using MULTER ---
-> We can't handle files using express or other tech stack. Morever we don't handle file on our server, We used third party services nad AWS.
-> File Handling should will not be used in every endpoints therefore we made it in Separate Utility File to reuse them. And whenever we 
    need that file we used that as middleware("Jaane se pehle mujhse milkar jaana").
-- cloudinary --
-> Here we are using Cloudinary as third party service to handle file, We also need some packages in backend - there are two opptions first
    is express-fileupload and second is Multer, we will use multer here.
-> So now we will signup on Cloudinary which gives cloud_name, api_key and api_secret which we have to add in .env file but first we have to
    install Cloudinary and then we will add keys in .env file.
-> We upload file through multer we cannot upload file using direct Cloudinary, Cloudinary is a service/sdk like aws.
-> Here we will do two tasks first is we get the file from user using multer and keep that file on our local server temporary then in 
    second step/task using Cloudinary we get the file from local storage and upload it ono server. We used both task in production grade.
-> We make a file named Cloudinary.service.js which contains file uploading code. Here our goal is to get the file from server by local path 
    through file system and upload it on Cloudinary. Also delete that file from local server after uploading the file on Cloudinary.
-> We import v2 as Cloudinary from Cloudinary then we import "fs" file system of nodeJs to get the path of file. Here in "fs" we are    
    using "unlink" - If path refers to a symbolic link, then the link is removed without affecting the file or directory to which that link
    refers. If the path refers to a file path that is not a symbolic link, the file is deleted.
-> In NodeJs File System files are linked or unlinked, When we delete a file that file got unlinked from file system but the file is saved 
    there in storage it just unlinked from the "fs".
-> Now we configured the Cloudinary in cloudinary.service.js, this configuration gives the access to file upload.
-> We will make a method that takes file path to upload file and deletes or unlink the files after uploading file from file system and 
    there can be problem in uploading therefore we will try-catch also used async. We use cloudinary upload method and pass filePath to it.
    We uploaded the file and returned the response to the user then we have to handle catch, We will delete/unlink the file from the file
    system if file not uploaded on cloudinary to prevent from malicious files on server. We used unlinkSync means this has to be done.
    then we export uploadCloudinary function.


---> Now we will use multer as middleware, we ccan use multer directly but here we are using as middleware and wherever we need file 
    uploading capabilities then we inject the multer there.
-> We saw in docs that we can store the file in two storage first is Diskstorage(Storage) and second is Memory Storage (Buffer), Here we 
    are using Diskstorage to save heavy files.
-> diskStorage has two properties - destination and filename, both posses a function which consists request from user contains json and 
    params, files which contains files from user this is the additional parameter which comes from multer, and cb which is callback function.
    In destination cb takes two parameter - 1st is error handling default is null and 2nd is folder destination which we gives our
    'public/temp' path.
    In filename we have file which consists many methods in it like - originalFilename means we save the file with the namw which user gives.
    Filename is used for naming the file due to saving the file in storage. here we used Date.now() as preSuffix with filename.
-> we store the multer in upload constant and export it. 
-> Now we can use this upload method in our routes as parameter to upload that file - 
    app.post('/profile', upload.single('avatar'), function (req, res, next))





--- HTTP ---
-> HTTP and HTTPs have same technologu but HTTPs have extra layer of security. The data sending in network will get encrypted where https
    sends data in clear text not encrypted.
-> URL - Uniform Resource Locator, URI - Uniform Resource Identifier and URN - Uniform Resource name
-> HTTP header - When we send a http request then we have to send some information with that request which is called metadata.
    And the metadata is called http header. 
-> Metadata - It is key-value pair data sent along with request and response. Metadata is used in Catching, Authentication and 
    State Management (Knowing about the state of user, is user is logged in or guest).
-- Type Of Headers --
-> Request Header comes from client, Response Header comes from Server and it should be standardized, Representation Headers - It tells 
    the data is in which endcoding and in which compression(zip files, Here we sent the data in compressed form because network has a limit)
    and Palyload Headers - data

-- Most Common Headers --
1. Accept - It indicates that which form of data is acceptable like - json
2. User-Agent - It shows the information source who sends request request like - application, browser etc.
3. Authorization - Bearer___jwt_token_
4. Content Type - img, pdg, mp4 etc.
5. Coockie - It is an object {}, which consists key-value pair data like - unique code, time to save user Coockie etc.
6. Cache-Control - If the data wants to be in network within a given time 

Although We have some headers like - CORS Headers and Security Headers

-- HTTP Methods --
-> Basic set of operations that can be used to interact with server.
• GET : retrieve a resource
• HEAD : No message body (response headers only)
• OPTIONS: what operations are available
• TRACE : loopback test ( get same data)
• DELETE : remove a tesource
• PUT : replace a de source
• POST : interact with resource (mostly add)
• PATCH : change part of a resource


-- HTTP Status Code --
• 1xx Informational
• 2xx Success
• 3xx Redirection
• 4xx Client extor
• 5xx server error

100 Continue
102 Processing
200 Ok
201 created
202 accepted
307 temporary redirect
308 permanent redirect
400 Bad request
401 Unauthorized
402 Payment required
404 Not Found
500 Internal Server Error
504 Gate way time Out




---- Router and Controller ----
-> Now we wil Register the User, So will make a file in in controller folder as user.controller.js . In Util we make helper file of an
    asynHandler wrapper to handle promises and error so that we don't need to use try-catch again and again. So we import asyncHandler in
    user controller.
-> Here we will write a function in asyncHandler Wrapper and hold it in a variable registerUser, then we pass a async function in 
    asyncHandler which is a higer order funciton. Now in response we send status code 200 and a message "ok".

-- Routes --
-> We made controller but the methods runs when an URL hitted, So we have to setup the routes.
-> So we make a user.route.js which is a user router file in routes folder. We import Router in it, initialized as router it and export it.  


-> So we exported the user controller and user route, now we will import both in app.js we can import in index.js but we want to keep it 
    clean.
-> Now we will import user router in index.js, we will import route after the previous configuration of app.js.
-> Now we will declare the routes before we were using app.get() method because we were writing routes in app.js the router is not in 
    different file. But in this case user router is in different file therefore to get the router in this file we will use middleware 
    so we use app.use() method.
-> Then we make route using router, we use router's method route() which takes the endpoint ("/register"). After that putting {.}  we can
    access the methods like get, post, put etc. then we pass the user controller (registerUser) in get(), post(registerUser) as argument.
->  Now the URL form like this - http://localhost:8000/users/register. But we have to define the versions of api in route 
    , In industry we don't use the route like this - app.use("/users", userRouter), We use this method which is an standardize method - 
     app.use("/api/v1/users", userRouter).


-- User Register --
-> We should breakdown our the problem in small steps
1. We should get the user data from the front end.
2. validation - to check the user data is valid according to the user model or not.
3. We will check that user us already exists or not using email or username.
4. Check for images and avatar 
5. Upload them to cloudinary, get the url and we have to check that data is saved on cloudinary successfully or not.
6. Now we will make an object because we send the data on mongodb as object. So create entry in DB.
7. When we send data in DB, DB returns that data and we will send the data to the user by removing the password and refresh_token field.
8. Check for user creation 

-- 1 --  
-> We use re.body to get the data from user from form or in json. And then we store those details in an object by destructuring the data.
-> After successfully raw data fetching from user, But we don't have any option to send files therefore we will use multer middleware here.
-> Now we will use the multer in user routes, so we will import {upload} from multer middleware. Then We will use {upload} as argument in 
    user route in post just before user controller {userRegisteration}. 
-> Now this upload gives us many options to send the data but we select fields, So upload.fields() takes argument as an array of objects
    So we pass two objects here, one for avatar and second for coverImage. We have to give name of data and maxCount of data in options in
    object. 

-- 2 --
-> Now we have to validate the data is empty or not, We will implement if-else and check that. But we have many fields and writing if-else
    for every field will become very hectic, therefore we wil use this method - In if condition block We take all the data in array. And We 
    will use some() method.
    
    The some() method of Array instances tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.
    It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns false. 
    It doesn't modify the array.
    
    the some() which consists an callback and this callback has access of elements of arrayfunction as {field} then in function block
    if function returns ture for any element, the function becomes true for all element.
    If field is present then we trim the filed and check is it empty, then we return true. 
-> So above we are checking if there is any element which is empty then we implement if block code which is error code.
-> For error handling we made a utility file apiError so we will use that, import that file and use it with {new} keyword to throw the error.
    We  will fill the details in apiError() to handle the error with standardize way.

-- 3 --
-> To check the user is already exists or not we will use {User} from user model, Now the user will call the mongodb on behalf of us as 
    much times we want.
-> So we import User from models, then we will use its methods like - findOne() which find the data in fields. It takes field in object as
    argument. But here we want to check for two fields therefore here we have operators which we used with {$}. Here we use or with
    respect to an array of objects, objects consists the fields like this - {$or: [{field1}, {field2}]}.
    Now we hold the reference of the User in a variable as existedUser then we perform if-else operation to send error to the user.

-- 4 --
-> At now we are getting the data from req.body but in files case we used middlewares in routes, then this middleware also gives some access 
    of data means it adds more fields in request.
-> So express gives us the body access of req then multer gives us the access of file of req - {req.files}. It is possible that we have 
    access of files or not therefore we should do optional chaining. If avatar exists then we will use it's 1st property which gives an 
    object which gives path of the file on server we should also use it with optional chaining. Then we will hold the req.files in 
    a variable called avatarLocalPath.
-> Now we will check the file is present or not, atleast the avatar should be present because we made it required in user model.

-- 5 --
-> then We will upload the file or avatar on cloudinary for which we have a service uploadCloudinary() we will pass the avatarLocalPath
    as argument in uploadCloudinary(). Now it can take time so we use await here and hold it in a variable avatar.
    Same used for coverImage.
    THen we check that file uploaded or not.

-- 6 -- 
-> Now we save the data in mongodb using User model method create(), It takes data in Object. Here we pass files url and username in 
    lowerCase.
-> Now when we are communicating with database it is possible that an error can rise so therefore we write the whole code in our
    asyncHandler which deals with the error but it will take time so we have to use await and hold the opeartion in a variable called user.

-- 7 --
-> Now we want to send the data to the User back in  front end, but we don't want some data to forward in frontend like password and 
    refresh_token.
-> So we use User Model method finById() to search a user from its _id, So if user created then we can find that user by the above 
    user's _id field.

-- 8 --
-> Now we check for user creation successfully or not, For that we can chain in the above finById() method with select() on user fields.
    it takes field's names in String to select that fields. But here we want to unselect the fileds so we can use in fileds {-ve} sign.
-> We will take the user's details with the above unselected fileds in a variable createdUser and return it to the frontend.

-- 9 --
-> Now we will send the user details to the front end with unselected fields, for this we are using our utility file apiResponse.
-> We will return the the response with status code and json, the json is consisting the ApiResponse() funciton which takes some details. 


--- Postman ---
-> There is postman collection which has to be share with frontend.
-> Now we will send the data in postman with form-data, here we are using form data because in JSON we don't have option to send files. 
-> After sending post request from postman the user has been registered and image has been uploaded in cloudinary. Now we have to unlink
    the file from file system means we after uploading image successfully we need to remove the image or file from file system.
    We will do this in cloudinary service after successfully upload.
-> Now we tried to send data without coverImage, then we can get an undefined error which is the issue of core JavaScript here beccause 
    we are using optional chaining. We have to check coverImage with classic if-else appraoch, in if bloack we will check for req.files    
    is present or not && checked for array of coverImage by using Array method isArray(req.files.coverImage)  && we will check for the 
    length of array of coverImage is > 0 or not.
-> If the above if block is true then we will set the localPath for coverImage.
-> After the above process we are able to send the the data without coverImage.
-> Now we will configure the Postman by a=making collections and adding environment variables.




--- Access Refresh Token, Middleware and cookies ---
-> We generated two tokens, we can do the work in only access token also. Both are generated with same method, but access token is
    is short lived and refresh_token is long lived. access_token expires in short term and refresh_token expires in long term because 
    A user with access token can do the Authorization related task like file - uploading, checking data etc. but if the login session   
    expires in 15 minutes then the user have to login again, Here refresh_token comes It saves on the user side and on database as well.
    We validate user rwith access token but they don't need to login again and again, the user just hit an endpoint which checks the user's
    refresh_token and refresh_token in database is same or not. If tokens are same then the user loginned without entering pass and username


---  Login User in user controller ----
-> By using both tokens we will make loginUser. Now we will have to break the problem into steps.
1. To get data from req.body and Validation of username or email and password
2. Checking the the username or email already exists or not
3. If user found then check the password correct or not 
4. Generate access_token and refresh_token 
5. Send the token to the user in secure cookies.

-- 1 --
-> We get the data from req.body and hold it in an object. We need username or email, one of them to login so we check throgh if-else
    that username || email is present or not, If both are not present then we throw an error using ApiError()

-- 2 --
-> Validating User is present or not through User Model method finOne() It takes the field as argument. We want to check for two fields
    therefore we are using {$or: [{email},{username}]}
-> Database in different continent therefore we write await and hold it in a variable called user.
-> If the user if not present we check throgh if() then we throw an error using APiError

-- 3 --
-> Now we will check the user password matchs with database password or not. We are doing this with bcrypt, We already made a method
    isPasswordCorrect() to compare user password and Database password. It takes user's password in argument. then we will hold it 
    in a variable called isPassword and write await because it is checking in database.
-> Now If password is incorrect then we send an error throgh ApiError.

-- 4 --
-> Now We will generate access_token and refresh_token, But we are going to do this many times therefore we will keep them in a async method
    called  generateAccessAndRefreshTokens(). The method takes userId as parameter also it use try-catch, catch handled by ApiError() and try
    we find the user using User.findById() and writing await also hold the user details in a variable called user. 
    Then we will generate token one by one and hold them in variables called refreshToken and accessToken.
-> Now we generated the token and hold it in variables but We have to save the refresh_token in database. So we assign the refreshToken to 
    the user {user.refreshToken = refreshToken} Then we save this change in database.
-> But while saving one field in database the other fileds in model also gets initialized like - password. Therefore we pass an parameter
    in save({validateBeforeSave: false}) means no need to validate before saving also it takes time so we write await.
-> we return the access_token and refresh_token to the user.
-> Now We done with the method which creates tokens, But we didn't implement in loginUser therefore we call the above method in loginUser
    We pass the user._id as argument in method also write await because it may take time. Now we hold the returned token in an object.

-- 5 -- 
-> The refresh_token field in user is empty because we have didn't save the data in database. here we can do two things 1st is we can update
    the refreshToken of user here like - user.refreshToken = refreshToken, 2nd method is we can make a database call.
-> Now we send the tokens in coockies, But before that we got unwanted fields - like password from User.findOne(). So we hold the user 
    details without password and refreshToken by select method of findById() to send the details in frontend.
-> Now we want to send cookies and when we send coockies we have to design some options which is an object. Cookies are Bydefault modifiable
    by anyone in frontend but when we do httpOnly: true, and secure: true Then these cookies are only modifiable from server It cannot  
    modify in from frontend.
-> Now we return the response in loginUser method. Status and cookies, We send individual cookies with options. we cand send cookes as many
    as we want by {.} like - status(200).cookie("accessToken", accessToken, options).cookie("refreshToken", refreshToken, options)
    then we send a json response throug ApiResponse(), which consists status code, {user: loggedInUser, accessToken, refreshToken}, 
    message = "user logged in successfully"
-> sending refresh token if user wants to save the tokens according to their use.



--- Logout User in User Controller ---
-> We make a method called logoutUser() managed by asynHandler. Now we breakdown the problem in steps.
1. Clear cookies
2. remove refresh_token from user's database as well

-> Now we have idea of operatins but the problem is we don't have access of user. For this we will design our own middleware.
-> We make a auth.middleware.js file in middleware folder which verifies that user is present or not. We verify on the basis of tokens
    because when user logged in they gets tokens, this is the true loggin. We verify that the user has correct tokens or not.
-> If tokens are valid then we inject an object req.user in req.body 
-> So we will use asynHandler here the function takes (req, res, next) because it is middleware. Now we have access of all cookies here in 
    request.
-> We can access the accessToken through cookies but we do optional chaining here because it is possible that there is not access of 
    accessToken in cookies in the case of mobile application means user is sending custom header. So we will check the req.header() method,
    the common header we get from the user is "Authorization" as argument in req.header("Authorization"). But the header Authorization
    header contains : Bearer "token", So we need to replace this {Bearer } with {""} empty string using JavaScript and hold it in a variable
    called token.
-> Now if token is not present then throw an error using ApiError(). But if token is present then should check the token using jwt.
    So we import jwt, using jwt we decoding the details of user from the token. To verify we have jwt.verify() method which takes token and
    access_token_secret to decode the token. also hold that in a variabel called {decodedToken}.
    This access_token_secret is the access to decode the token.
-> After getting decodedToken the details from jwt, We get _id from the decodedToken and search for the _id in mongodb using User model 
    method findById() and also we write it await and stores in a variabel called {user}.
-> Now if user is not present then send error throgh ApiError(). 
-> If user is present, as we have access of request then we inject an object in it by {req.user = user} then we add next() in last.
-> We mainly use the middlewares in Routes.
-> We have to wrap the whole text in try-catch
** Shortcut of vscode to wrap any code in try-catch - Select the code that want to be in try-catch, then after selection write try-catch 
    and enter, the code will be in try catch.**

-- Adding Route for Login in User Routes --
-> Make a route in user Route, We made a route for login. Make a secure route section and write route for logout, in post() before login
    controller add verifyJWT middleware thats it.

-> Now after adding auth middleware verifyJWT in logout route, We get access of req.user in logoutUser contoller now we can implement the 
    logout funciton by extracting req.user._id.
-> Now we have to update refresh_token as undefined in mongodb for that we have a method findByIdAndUpdate(), which takes argument 1st is
    _id here req.user._id and then what will be the updated data in objects for that we have an operator of mongoDB called {$set:} to update
    the field data like - { $set: { refreshToken: undefined}}. We can also add {new: true}.
-> Now Clearing cookies in response and for that we need options. We clear the cookies with the help of clearCookie() method, which takes 
    token and options in argument. And also send json response throgh ApiResponse().
-> In production grade app if the (res) is not in use then we write it (_).


--- Tokens ---
-> Access token and refresh_token are used only for this purpose so that a user don't need to enter password and email again and again.
-> access_token is short lived like for 1day, and after 1 day user have to login again using password and email then the user get new 
    access_token.
-> But in google purposed this that there should be two tokens 1st is access_token which will saved on user's browser also will be short 
    lived like - 15 or 30 minutes and 2nd token is sessionStorage also called refresh_token which we save on user side and in database as 
    well. 
-> So if user's access token get expired then user get a 401 request, So in frontend we can do that if user is getting 401 request
    when their access_token expires then they should hit an endpoint and refresh their access token. User is sending refresh_token along 
    with request then in database a refresh_token is saved so if we found that user then we send new access token with respect to the user.
-> Now we have to give an endpoint so that frontend user can hit and get the new access_token.

-- Making Endpoint to get new access_token --
-> So we make a controller with name refreshAccessToken which is handled by asyncHandler(). We need refresh_token for further implementation,
    we get the refresh_token from request cookies and or from body if user is android also stores in a variable {incomingRefreshToken}.
    then we didn't get the refresh_token then we send an error throgh ApiError().
-> Now we have to verify the refresh_token using jwt and stores the decoded token in a variabel called {decodedToken}. Now we find  
    _id of user using mongoose User.finById() and hold the user info in variabel {user}. Then we check user is present or not if not then 
    we throw an error.
-> Now we will match the saved refresh_token and incomingRefreshToken if they are not same then we throw an error. If the refresh_token matched
    then we generate new access_token and refresh_token with a method which we defined earlier called generateAccessAndRefreshTokens().
-> Now we make options to send the response and cookies. We send ApiResponse() in json() also sending accessTOken and refreshToken in response.
    We should wrap the code in try-catch from decodedToken to response, so we will wrap it. And send error through ApiError in Catch block.

-- Setting Endpoint in Routes --
-> We will make a route for access token regeneration in secured routes section with route name "/refresh-token" 



---- Subscription Model ----
-> In models folder we make a subscription.models.js file, and create a schema with the help of mongoose.

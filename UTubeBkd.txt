-> Here we are taking images from user So we upload those images on third party Storage :- AWS or Cloudnery. But before uploading those 
    images on cloud we Store them on our server temporarly for utilising those data in case of any connection loss to send the images on 
    cloud.
-> To store temporary images on server we make a folder for that called :- {temp} which is inside of {public} folder. Now git cannot push
    the empty folders on github, So to upload the {temp} folder on server so that temporary images can be stored in the temp folder in 
    future. Therefore we make file of {.gitkeep} which is empty, It is helpful in tracking these types of Util Folders.

-> Now we will make {.gitignore} and those files which should not be upload on git. In market we habe ..gitignore generator which consists
    predefined .gitignore files according to the project/Tech Stack, like here we have-{https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/}
    We just need to copy and paste it in .gitignore file and we can add from our side as well.

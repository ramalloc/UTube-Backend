-> Here we are taking images from user So we upload those images on third party Storage :- AWS or Cloudnery. But before uploading those 
    images on cloud we Store them on our server temporarly for utilising those data in case of any connection loss to send the images on 
    cloud.
-> To store temporary images on server we make a folder for that called :- {temp} which is inside of {public} folder. Now git cannot push
    the empty folders on github, So to upload the {temp} folder on server so that temporary images can be stored in the temp folder in 
    future. Therefore we make file of {.gitkeep} which is empty, It is helpful in tracking these types of Util Folders.

-> Now we will make {.gitignore} and those files which should not be upload on git. In market we habe ..gitignore generator which consists
    predefined .gitignore files according to the project/Tech Stack, like here we have-{https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/}
    We just need to copy and paste it in .gitignore file and we can add from our side as well.

-> Now we will make .env file

-> Now to organise our file we make src folder, then we make app.js, constants.js, index.js files in src.
-> After that we will make some folders in src :- 
    controller - It includes functionalities majorally, db - It consists database connectivity configurations, 
    middlewares - They are the codes which we want to run in b/w, like checking the request b/w client and server,
    models, routes, utils - It consists the repeated functions which are used consecutively / again an again in different files. 
-> When we make project with team then there is high chance that the code can show conflicts because different style of code which creates
    issue while merging the code on github. So the formatting of code should be same and consistent. Therefore we use {prettier} as library,
    the formatting can be changed as every project requirements therefore we can use prettier generator tools as well.
    After installing the prettier we have to include some files manually, First we have to make a file {.prettierrc} in src folder, It is 
    configuration file of prettier like :- comma, semicolon etc. details. Second file we make is {.prettierignore}, It consists those
    file names where we don't want to implement the prettier.
